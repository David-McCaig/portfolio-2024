With me, you'll find a versatile skill set that aligns with the demands of this job, including effective communication, strong problem-solving, collaborative teamwork, and the ability to learn new technologies quickly in a fast-paced environment. During my time as a Full Stack Developer at Chance Voight, I honed my skills in designing, developing, and maintaining responsive web applications using HTML,Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Figma. I worked extensively with React, Supabase, and Mixpanel, ensuring that our applications met high standards of performance and usability. My role involved collaborating closely with multiple teams to ensure alignment with product, design, and marketing strategies. In addition to building the software, I took the lead in designing the applications using Figma, creating visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces. For DevOps, we primarily used GitHub, which provided me with a solid understanding of the DevOps lifecycle, including experience with version control and continuous integration practices. I have also been developing an audio visualisation app to assist people with Parkinson's. This app features a 3D globe created with Three.js that changes colour based on the user's speaking volume, providing visual feedback to help users adjust their speaking volume. Currently, the app is being used by a rehab clinic and a private speech therapy clinic. This project highlights my ability to work with complex graphics and animations, aligning with the needs of Capital Preferences. You can check out the app here VolumeLight Throughout my career, I have consistently demonstrated my ability to bridge the gap between design and development, ensuring that the end product not only meets technical specifi cations but also provides an exceptional user experience. My hands-on experience with modern web development tools and practices, coupled with my dedication to creating user-centric applications, makes me well suited for the UI Developer role at Capital Preferences. I am eager to bring my expertise to your team and contribute to the development of innovative financial technology products.
